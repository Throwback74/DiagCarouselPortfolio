					<div class="content__text">An early project built with jQuery, this is an interactive game that dynamically updates the HTML page using the jQuery library. The game works as follows - there will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page, and the player will be shown a random number at the start of the game. When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. This amount is hidden until the player clicks on the crystal, and when they do click one, the game updates the player's score counter. The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game. The player loses if their score goes above the random number. The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses. When the game begins again, the player is shown a new random number, all the crystals will have four new hidden values, and the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero. The app also shows the number of games the player wins and loses without refreshing the page as a means to restart the game.

					<div class="content__text">First project working with APIs, this app uses jQuery and AJAX calls to connect with the GIPHY API and searches for GIFs of some of my favorite things from childhood. Using an array of the favorite things I created buttons with properties that will run an AJAX call and pull gifs based on the name of the button down to the page. I then created an input that allows the user to enter their own topics that will insert those entries into the array and creates a new button for them to use to search for GIFs using that search term.

Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so much fun. I get started on them and I have a hard time stopping. But we're not there yet, so we don't need to worry about it. Now let's put some happy little clouds in here. What the devil. A thin paint will stick to a thick paint.

					<div class="content__text">See. We take the corner of the brush and let it play back-and-forth. This is unplanned it really just happens. I'm sort of a softy, I couldn't shoot Bambi except with a camera. I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's okay though; I have more fun than most people. We'll play with clouds today. Didn't you know you had that much power? You can move mountains. You can do anything. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much. Work on one thing at a time. Don't get carried away - we have plenty of time. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. These trees are so much fun.

					<div class="content__text">So often we avoid running water, and running water is a lot of fun. Everyone is going to see things differently - and that's the way it should be. A big strong tree needs big strong roots. Steve wants reflections, so let's give him reflections. We don't have to be committed. We are just playing here. Making all those little fluffies that live in the clouds. Let's go up in here, and start having some fun The least little bit can do so much. Work on one thing at a time.
